# Excel Report Generator
This is a simple sample project of using Python for generating Excel report. The program starts with a primitive GUI, who is created based on the code generated from [GUI.tcl](src/GUI.tcl) by [PAGE](http://page.sourceforge.net/). In the GUI, a directory can be input as the location to store the generated Excel file after clicking the "Generate" button. The program uses the [`world`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/world-setup/en/) database from MySQL as an example data source. For working with Excel, `win32com` from [`pywin32`](https://github.com/mhammond/pywin32) is used. After Data is put into an Excel workbook, an Excel pivot table is drawn from the data. Then the workbook is saved and stored.
